# Proposal

The public data set for our project is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult from UCI machine learning repository. The data for this project is from the 1994 us census database. 

Our research proposal for this project is to determine what are the strongest attributes to determine a salary greater than $50,000. This will be a predictive question.

Our plan is to 
- load the dataset into R 
- explore the dataset
- data wrangling to clean and prepare the data according to our research project
- divide the dataset into training and testing
- use a decision tree algorithm on the training set
- apply the resulting model to the testing set
- compare the testing statistics to the training statistics (ex. accuracy) in a table or visualization such as a tree
- return to the decision trees to determine the strongest attributes leading to a salary greater than $50,000.
