# adult_income_prediction_project

The public data set for our project is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult from UCI machine learning repository. The data for this project is from the 1994 us census database. 

Our research proposal for this project is to determine what are the strongest attributes to determine a salary greater than $50,000. This will be a predictive question.

Our plan is to 
- load the dataset into R 
- explore the dataset
- data wrangling to clean and prepare the data according to our research project
- apply a decision tree model to answer our research question
